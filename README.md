## Running code on local *nix machine
Backend API is written in Nodejs using Express framework. The code sends "Hello Stakater" by default if no environment variable `NAME` is set. The code works on port 8080 be default and if given environment variable `PORT`, it will use that port number. It is uses localhost as ip address. `http://localhost:8080` displays the backend output
